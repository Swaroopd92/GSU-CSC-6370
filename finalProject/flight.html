                     typical airplane seat. one caveat though - there is ac power, but i used it with my ipad mini 2 and it drained the battery. so keep that in mind if you have a similar device. that aside, its a pretty good comfort seat. id buy for sure.                  </div>

                     26F is slightly narrower than an average seat. The seat has a full separation under the armrest, but more importantly the seatbealt is shorter which may cause an issue for customers of size.                  </div>

                     I bought comfort + and these seats are marked comfort + on chart. But the knee room is same as economy, and very tight. This one row is clearly mismarked as comfort + and I now have to take up getting a refund with delta corporate. The rest of the comfort+ seats have much more leg room. Luckily I took scaled pictures. DO NOT CHOOSE THIS ROW!                  </div>

                     Avoid this plane if possible. This is a VERY old plane with EXTREMELY noisy engines. Row 32 is right in front of the engine so a lot of noise/vibration.  It seemed like the plane and my seat were shaking from the engine the whole flight.                  </div>

                     Flight was on tail number N692DL. 

Was in 26D and the arm rest for these seats was solid and could not be raised like the belonged to the exit row. Also the site says the seat pitch reduces toward the back of the plane however I had no issue with legroom (had some to spare even) in row 26 and 27 being 6' 3". On other MD88 flights i've been rows 16-18 and been more cramped. I plan on sitting toward the back more on future flights.                  </div>

                     Although 24A does not have full recline, the back of you seat is less likely to be kicked since 25A is also exit and has extra leg room. I find that in 25A my seat gets kicked or hit quite often by the person behind me.                  </div>

                     Economy class on these MD-88 is a joke. I am a big guy (6'4" 300) but i can normally do just fine in refular economy. My fligjt ATL-MIA was the worst flight of my life. Pitch is MAYBE 30", and the width is even worse. This plane is super tight! Avoid if possible                  </div>

                     Horrific seat for Delta "Comfort".  Seat cushion was very thin a d very short, notocinle loss of circulation to my legs, yes i am tall. I would certainly not pay a premium for this seat.  Overall plane was hot durimf the entire trip from CAK to ATL.  I am really beginning to HATE the MD 88 ...                  </div>

                     This is a Comfort+ seat and the extra leg room was noticeable.  I am 5'9" and slim.  The middle seat was empty which was nice.  The armrest does go up.  There is no seatback monitor but there are power outlets between the seats in front of this row.  The did serve free alcohol in our section even being a short flight from MCI to MSP.  I would recommend any seat in this row.                  </div>

                     This seat has extra legroom although it is narrower with a middle arm rest that cannot be raised (that is sometimes a great feature depending on who is in 32B). Tray is in the arm rest. I'm 6'3" and able to stretch out my legs nicely. The seat in front is a bit away so unless you are tall you'll have trouble reaching the seat pocket or underseat storage with the seat belt on.                  </div>

                     This is a standard exit row seat with one twist: First, like most exit rows it has extra space and no recline.  But, this seat also has no armrest next to the exit door, which could be a problem on flights over 2 hours, or if your looking to sleep, etc.                  </div>

                     Worst flight ever.  I am 6 feet tall, 170 lbs. I fly 20-30 flights/year.  I did NOT fit in this seat.  The distance from the back of the seat to the tray table did not accommodate the length of my legs and I was forced to sit at an angle for 3 hours.  Super uncomfortable.  Again, worst plane ride ever.                  </div>

                     This is a Delta Comfort window seat& it was the most uncomfortable and small seat I have ever sat in.  The arm rest does NOT go up, and there is a tray in the arm rest (or something...didn't pull it out) which makes the seat more narrow.  The extra so-called leg room is barely noticeable.  I would never book this class again.  They need to have the arm rest go up for more room!!!  My husband and I were totally squashed in.                  </div>

                     I paid $9 to upgrade to this seat which was shown on Delta's website as being a Delta Comfort Seat. When I got to my seat I realized this was not a Delta Comfort Seat. I hailed a stewardess and was moved to seat 14D. The regular seats on these planes are very cramped. My Delta flights that day on the MD-88 and the 717-200 had annoying engine fumes the whole way.                  </div>

                     Surprisingly pleasant aircraft and seat. Even though it is an old plane, noise was not too bad. A smooth flight and seat 27D offers ample legroom. (And I am 6' 3"). Window is aligned, so one can see enough (wing, and behind it).                  </div>

                     Flew on this old bird from MSP-ABQ. The aircraft is old inside. Lets make that clear. The seats are old as well as the bins and other fittings. Bins were very small and the leg room was tight. I would only recommend flying this plan if you are an aviation geek and love old planes. If you're just an average traveler you will be much happier on a 737 or A320.                  </div>

                     Horrible seat. I am a small woman and felt cramped sitting next to an average size adult man. I am 5'5" and my knees were less than 2 inches from the back of the seat i front of me. The view from the window was of the engine and the noise was awful. As if all of this wasnt enough, I has the pleasure of sitting in front of 2 ill behaved children who kicked my seat while the parent read a book with earbuds in his ears.                  </div>

                     Do NOT recommend! Windows are not spaced well for this seat - you aren't leaning into the window, but into the space between windows, which cuts off at least 2" of elbow room. Grr... i hate seats like this.                  </div>

                     Great seats!! Was very surprised that these older planes have the most comfortable seats!! Would recommend flying on delta's md 80's for sure.                  </div>

                     Seat 17A was amazing on my flight from SRQ to ATL. The seat has a good wing view from the front and is very close to the front of the aircraft. The snack service was qiuck because was so close. Delta does a great job keeping their planes neat and modern, I could barley tell our aircraft was 17 years old. I totally recomend seat 17A especially if you want to get on and off the plane a lot quicker                  </div>

                     Not bad, window lovers rejoice for you can lay claim to two windows! One at shoulder provides a little extra room, one beside 19E seatback provides best view without too much strain on neck. And not awful legroom either, slim 6'4" with knees just off the forward seatback. Two-up seating on this side.                  </div>

                     Decent seat, better than average recline.  Only problem is that there is a bulkhead in the ceiling that prevents the doors to the overhead bins for rows 25 and 26 from opening completely on either side of the plane; this makes it impossible to load larger carryons.  Had to stick mine over 28 which made for a tricky exit upon deplaning.                  </div>

                     This seat was the best Premium Economy seat I've ever sat in. I was able to fully extend my legs and still have a couple inches to spare. The only complaints I have are that the tray table was a little difficult to open, and the amount of legroom made it harder to reach your personal items. Otherwise, an A+ seat!                  </div>

                     Seat 11D.  This is a very narrow seat due to the tray table in the armrest.  I could not fit my pelvic bone crests into this seat and sat sideways from MEM to ATL.                  </div>

                     I forgot to mention in my previous review.  As with other reviews, the engines on this plane are very loud. Even at row 31, they were kind of a nuisance.  If engine noise is bothersome for you, I would recommend a seat toward the front of the plane.                  </div>

                     This seat is the sweet spot; why it has mixed reviews I have no idea.  Same width as other seats, and the arm rests are not fixed like other ER seats.

I would take this seat over 33A, as 33A is hugging the curve of the wall and the Emergency Exit door cramps in on your space - as well as the flight attendant when they are seated directly in front of you on a jump seat, facing you.                  </div>

                     Comfort+ is good on your backside and could be tolerated for many hours, width isnt great but sufficient, economy seats on delta are like wood, no padding. It would be revolutionarty of Delta to adopt the comfort+ seat to standard economy. The alcohol, its included in comfort+, they only had one mixed drink available from the menu but was decent. Is the upgrade worth it at $30 over economy? yes.                  </div>

                     More leg room than Delta's 757-200, but the arm rests were lacking - thin, hard, immovable, and really only one in the center of D and E.  Row is on the wing, so the view is obscured (if you care), but it's a very quiet ride other than the occasional adjustment of flaps.  This plane didn't have charging stations/plugs or any TVs/screens mounted, but the interior was in good shape and didn't appear aging - just not upgraded.                  </div>

                     I sat in this from Dallas Tx to Atlanta Ga. I was very comfortable. I'm overweight and usually struggle to buckle my seatbelt, but I had extra room on the buckle in this seat. I'm 5'4 so I had plenty of room for my legs and my stuff was easy to get to under the seat in front. Takes longer to get off because its in the back, but I would sit here again.                  </div>

                     These "premimum seats" 10-14 are barely if anything anything more than regular seats, too much money for nothing. Delta should be ashamed of this ripoff, so typical these days.                  </div>

                     Worst seat ever. The engine is literally 15 inches from your ears. The noise is unbearable and you can't see anything through the window but the engine. Some kind of ears protection should be provided with this seat. I also have experienced a lot of strong vibrations                  </div>

                     I am 6' tall and have both knees replaced. Sitting with my rear pushed all the way back against the seatback, my knees still touched the seat in front. I wish I'd brought a measuring tape. I'm sure the seat pitch was less than the advertized miminum of 31". When the passengers in front jostled or moved, the seat dug painfully into my metal knees. I was miserable!                  </div>

                     Under no circumstances are you to sit in these seats. They're cramped, loud., smell, and have zero recline. The legroom amount I'm sure is smaller than the regular seats and at my 1.8m (5' 11") stature I was rubbing my knees against the metal arms. The engine roar is deafening, especially when reverse thrust is engaged on landing. Though there'd be nothing to see, the lack of a window can add to airsickness and nausea.

You are, frankly, sitting where a closet or storage might be and that makes me very sad to think about. If given the option to fly in these seats or walk to your destination, pick the latter.                  </div>

                     Maybe I was spoiled because on my outbound flight I flew in a Boeing 717-200 and the Comfort Section was CLEARLY roomier and more outfitted than the Coach section. But I didn't find this seat to be any better than the Coach seats three rows back, AND there was no AC outlet which was a bit frustrating. Tight fit and my bag, which fits EVERYWHERE - didn't fit in the overhead compartment and couldn't fit in its entirety under the seat in front of me.  I had to straddle my bag the whole flight.  It wasn't a bad experience, per se, just not the WONDERFUL experience I had on my outbound flight.                  </div>

                     Not a bad experience, just not the FANTASTIC experience I had in the Comfort Section on my outbound flight which was on a Boeing 717-200.  These Comfort seats didn't seem to be much different from the Coach seats three rows back and had no electrical outlets, which was a bit frustrating. Also, the overhead compartments were smaller.  I have a rollie that fits everywhere, but it wouldn't fit in the overhead, or even completely under the seat in front of me.  Much less space than expected.                  </div>

                     I am 6' and broad shouldered.  I flew in 16E and 17A recently.  Both seats have the same issues.  First is the pitch.  My knees were wedged against the seat in front.  I've lived with this before on other airlines, but something peculiar about the Delta seats.   Due to the narrow width of the seats, one knee was wedged against the seat frame and/or the metal spring for the magazine pouch.  This was extremely unpleasant.  Regarding width, I was in a window seat both ways and I could not sit up vertically due to the outside wall of the hull and the narrow seats.  I had to twist slightly to avoid pressing too much in to the person next to me.  I will avoid this air frame all together in the future.                  </div>

                     Worst seat ever. People are constantly in the bathrooms opening and closing the doors, Not to mention the unbearable noise of the engines. There are also no windows and there is so much vibration from the engines.I highly discourage you to sit in this seat unless you absolutely have to. In my case I booked very late and got assigned at the gate so i couldnt help it. The only good thing about this seat is that there is no seat next to you.                  </div>

                     sat in this seat on the MD88 LGA-MIA. Had good legroom for me (6ft tall) but strange thing is armrest was not moveable and tray table was both on seatback in front of me and in armrest - which was unusual since not an emergency exit row or bulkhead. Reduced seat width was noticeable.                   </div>

                     Seat 35 A should be free, if you decide to even sit there. Engine is right outside the window and the noise is unbearable. For those seats in the rear by the engine they should at least provide hearing protection of some kind.I would be interested to know the db level I was exposed to for the duration...                  </div>

                     For those who remember the DC-9's, once the workhorse of the Delta and Eastern fleets, this craft is very similar.  Overall I agree with others.  My seat looked to have been recently installed and was fine for a short-hop flight.  Service acceptable for FC and no traffic from Coach area was allowed unless an emergency.  But for a long haul flight, it would become uncomfortable.                  </div>

                     4C is a very comfortable seat. People do bump the seat when passing but, not everyone is aware of the luggage. Lots of leg room.The overhead compartment are larger on Right side.                  </div>

                     there is no seat in front, so personal items must be stowed above for take off and landing. However, a small pocket for reading material is to the left of the seat.                   </div>

                     I need to defend seat 11D!  I got seated in 11D because seating was not assigned until we got to the gate.  I had read the awful reviews here, but the only other option was 33C, and I didn't want to smell the lavatories.  As it turned out, it was roomier in terms of both leg room and width than the standard economy seats.  Also, the people who get to select these seats are in a special class that is below first class, but above standard economy.  They get free alcoholic beverages with these seats, which is a new rule that began March 1st, 2015.  I don't use alcohol, but I could have gotten a free drink as well, just for being in the seat!  By the way I am overweight, and I was able to fasten my seatbelt in 11D without an extender.  Back in 22C, I had to use an extender, because the regular seatbelt only went 75% around "me belly." Back in 22C, elbows were always an issue.  In 11D, my seat mates must not have had elbows, because I never got poked once.                  </div>

                     Delta's MD-88 are very comfortable. I travelled from LGA to MIA and the trip was very enjoyable. Note: try to choose a seat in front of the wing emergency exits, as the engine noise gets louder the further back you go!                  </div>

                     Interior seemed newly refreshed with crisp LED-based lights.  Legroom was very tight, pitch must be less than the 33-31 inches stated, I would guess 29-30, but the seats are not the ergo-slimline that make better use of space.  At 6'1, my knees pressed on the back of the seat in front and the tray table rested on my legs.   When the passenger in front tried to recline,  he could not, it was blocked painfully by my knees; the seat was empty next to me, so I could sit askew into the other seat and passenger could recline.. But if the seat had not been empty, it could have become contentious - there would have been no where for me to move my legs.                  </div>

                     One other comment for the first class seats is to be sure and try to book in row 2 or 3.  The overhead space is very limited for rows 1 due to emergency equipment.  Also no video on this aircraft type, but you can use onboard internet for viewing movies and TV shows and you don't have to pay for the GOGO inflight wifi, just use the Delta entertainment app.                  </div>

                     This is a dreadful seat with smaller seat width and immovable armrest.  Upon measuring the leg space, even the flight attendant agreed that the leg room was the same as regular economy seats.  Paying extra for this seat and the one next to it is a ripoff by Delta.  The attendant suggested that I contact the airline.                  </div>

                     Seat 10A on the MD88 is not a comfortable seat.  I was in this seat for the 1st of a 2 leg trip on the same aircraft.  The first row of economy comfort seats sit between the protruding ribs of the aircraft paneling.  What I experienced was the rib protruding into my shoulder.  Since the armrests were immovable, the seat width was unacceptable since I was more or less unable to sit straight up.  For the 2nd leg of my flight, I had a standard economy seat in row 17 which was way more comfortable, also a window seat!                  </div>

                     They must have fixed this seat at some point because it's hard as a rock.  Good thing it's only a short flight but it pinched my nerves and cut off feeling to my left leg.  Worst delta seat I've ever flown in.                  </div>

                     This was an awful first class seat. The plane's interior was newly updated. No less than 5 times did the flight attendants and other passengers squeeze in the small space in front of me to let someone pass by. My arm was often bumped as anyone passed by.The table tray was in the arm and did not slide forward enough. (I thought I must be big until I looked at the tiny person in 1D who had the same problem.) The pocket that hangs on the bulkhead in front of you is so small and tight that it's worthless. I made the mistake of putting my phone in there while I ate (no space elsewhere) and struggled foolishly to get it out. Not worth paying for this seat.                  </div>

                     Standard economy seat. Noise of the engine is still pretty loud up hear. You want to pick a seat in the front section of the economy cabine. These seats cost extra as they're sold as prefeered seating.                  </div>

                     Okay seat, on an old plane. I thought I was going to hate it, but it was a more fun ride instead of a larger plane. I wish they had entertainment!                  </div>

                     Worst seat I've ever sit in on a Delta Flight.  It was more like Economy Discomfort.  The seat has got to be thinner than usual already and then has a tray in the armrest and seatback.  10D/E & 11D/E are terrible if you care about seat width at all.                  </div>

                     Seat 36D is one of the worst seats in the plane.The smell of the lavatories is disgusting but what makes it worse is having to wait for everything as well as the flight attendants making all announcements from the back not to mention that the window is completely blocked by the engine                  </div>

                     I thought there might be a mistake when Seatguru reported the tray tables in the armrests as there is a tray on the seat back in front of this seat (and 11E) but indeed there is a tray in the armrest making the seat slightly narrower. A better choice might be 12 D or E as they have no tray in the armrest. Still offers more legroom than standard economy.                  </div>

                     This is a HORRIBLE seat. This should not be called a standard seat.

The view out of the window is completely obstructed by the jet engine, which appears to be about 5 inches outside of the window, meaning not only will takeoff and landing make you partly deaf, your bones will be seriously rattling during both. And if you are claustrophobic, you will not enjoy the view!                  </div>

                     Avoid this seat. Delta installed a flight attendant's jumpseat facing what would have been seat 32A. The fflight attendant's telephone equipment blocks the storage under the seat. Finally, this seat is an inch narrower than other coach seats                  </div>
